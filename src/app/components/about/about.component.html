      <span></span>
      <p class="lead">Our charming cafe, set in the beautiful town of Mount Pleasant,
        is the perfect place to meet friends
        and family for a relaxed breakfast, lunch or afternoon cup of coffe and plate of food.
        Amazing coffee doesn’t just simply happen. It takes a modern approach. It’s the endless pursuit of becoming
        something better in order to make a lasting impact to elevate those around us.</p>

      <h3 class="featurette-heading">Our Goal</h3>
      <p class="lead">At the end of the day, Raak can be many things to many people. It can be a very good cup of
        coffee, or the catalyst for innovative communication. The magic of a coffee shop is that once that environment
        is
        created, it becomes not just what the staff makes it, but what the customers make it. A true community happens.
        Raak does this with three simple staples: great coffee, great food and great performances. We believe there is
        something for everyone at Raak. Quality for All.</p>
